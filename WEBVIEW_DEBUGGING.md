# Webview Debugging Improvements

## Issue Description
The webview was showing "Checking Ollama connection..." but not updating with the connection status, even though the extension was successfully connecting to Ollama and sending the connection status message.

## Debugging Improvements Added

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Added comprehensive logging to both extension and webview sides
- Added logging for webview initialization, message sending, and message receiving
- Added verification that webview elements exist before updating them

### 2. Webview Lifecycle Management
- Added proper disposal management for webview resources
- Added cleanup of previous webview instances
- Added disposal event handling to prevent memory leaks

### 3. Connection Check Timing
- Added delay before initial connection check to ensure webview is ready
- Added verification that webview is still available before sending messages
- Added timeout-based verification after sending messages

### 4. Manual Debug Controls
- Added manual connection check button in webview
- Added debug info button to show webview state
- Added command to manually trigger connection check from extension

### 5. Message Validation
- Added logging for all message types received by webview
- Added verification that DOM elements exist before updating them
- Added fallback handling for missing elements

## New Commands Available

- `duvut-assistant.checkOllamaConnection` - Manually trigger Ollama connection check

## New Webview Features

- **üîÑ Check Connection** button - Manually check Ollama connection
- **üêõ Debug Info** button - Show current webview state and debug information

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Extension Output**: Look for debug messages in the "Duvut Assistant" output channel
2. **Check Webview Console**: Open browser dev tools in the webview to see console logs
3. **Use Manual Controls**: Click the manual connection check button to test connection
4. **Check Debug Info**: Click the debug info button to see webview state

## Expected Debug Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
[DEBUG] Starting Ollama connection check
[DEBUG] Webview available: true
[DEBUG] Webview webview available: true
[DEBUG] Ollama connection check result: true
[DEBUG] Found 4 models
[DEBUG] Sending to webview: {"type":"connectionStatus","connected":true,"models":["llama3.2:latest",...]}
[DEBUG] About to call this._view.webview.postMessage
[DEBUG] postMessage called successfully
[DEBUG] Post-message verification - webview still available: true
```

And in the webview console:
```
[Webview DEBUG] Webview initialized
[Webview DEBUG] connectionStatus element: <div class="connection-status" id="connectionStatus">
[Webview DEBUG] modelSelect element: <select id="modelSelect">
[Webview DEBUG] Sending checkConnection message
[Webview DEBUG] Received message: {type: "connectionStatus", connected: true, models: [...]}
[Webview DEBUG] Message type: connectionStatus
[Webview DEBUG] Handling connectionStatus: {type: "connectionStatus", connected: true, models: [...]}
[Webview DEBUG] Setting connected status
[Webview DEBUG] Connection status updated successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists:

1. **Check Webview Console**: Look for JavaScript errors or missing elements
2. **Verify Message Flow**: Ensure messages are being sent and received
3. **Check Element IDs**: Verify that DOM elements exist with correct IDs
4. **Test Manual Controls**: Use the manual connection check button
5. **Check Extension State**: Verify the extension is properly initialized

## Common Issues

1. **Timing Issues**: Webview might not be ready when connection check runs
2. **Element Not Found**: DOM elements might not exist when message is processed
3. **Message Not Received**: Webview message listener might not be properly set up
4. **Disposal Issues**: Webview might be disposed before message is processed
